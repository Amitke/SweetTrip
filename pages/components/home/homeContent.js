          <h3>Some Interesting Mythological Stories about Varanasi</h3>
          <p>
            Hindu mythology says, Shiva, one of the three principal deities,
            founded this holy city. Once, Shiva and Brahma had a fight, and lord
            Shiva tore off one of the five heads of lord Brahma. Since Brahma
            was a brahmin religion, Shiva had committed a brahmahatya by tearing
            one of his heads. As a result, the slain head of Brahma was stuck in
            Shiva’s hands. Shiva tried to remove his head, but couldn’t.
            Eventually, wandering around the world for eons, Shiva came to
            Banaras, and the hanging head of Brahma dropped here and disappeared
            into the ground.
