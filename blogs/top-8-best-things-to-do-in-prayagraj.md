1. Spend time in the Triveni Sangam – A Holy Confluence
</h2>
<p>
            Triveni Sangam itself is Prayagraj's pride. It is the confluence of three holy rivers Ganga, the Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati. Thousands of pilgrims from various walks of life visit here to take a sacred dip, which washes sin away from the soul and instils serenity of thought into the heart. It is magic when water sparkles with golden light at dawn. If you're looking for a sweet vacation, put this one at the top of the list.

              2. Take the Kumbh Mela – A Great Spiritual Festival
              </h2>
               <p>
                Prayagraj is world-renowned for staging the globe's largest religious celebration, Kumbh Mela. Celebrated once every 12 years, it draws millions of pilgrims, saints, and travellers to Triveni Sangam to worship with joy. Even if your visit may not overlap with the time of Kumbh Mela, Prayagraj gets a small religious fair like Ardh Kumbh every year. Seeing the vibrant festival is one of the most cohesive experiences in Prayagraj.

             3. Anand Bhavan – Home of the Nehru Family
              </h2>
               <p>
               The politicos and the history buffs will also have their own place at Anand Bhavan. Nehru's family house was an important location during India's struggle for independence.

              <p>Built in 1583 by Emperor Akbar, Allahabad Fort is stunning. Despite the Indian Army occupying most of the fort and not being fully open to tourists, travellers can visit some parts, such as the Patalpuri Temple and the sacred Akshay Vat tree. The stunning walls and buildings of the fort narrate about the pride of Mughal power, and thus it is amongst the most debonair activities to do in Prayagraj.</p>

              <p>For peace and tranquillity in your lovely car, go to Khusro Bagh. The old garden is the resting place of Prince Khusro (Jahangir's son) and other Mughal emperors. Lying in the dense green blanket and Mughal tombs, a paradise for history lovers, photography lovers, and even for those who simply want a peaceful walk away from city hustle and bustle.</p>
              <h2 className="mt-5 font-bold">6. Visit Allahabad Museum – Treasures of History and Art</h2>

               <h2 className="mt-5 font-bold">7. Shri Lete Hanuman Mandir – A Special Temple</h2>
              <p>You will find a temple named Shri Lete Hanuman Mandir on the Sangam bank. Lord Hanuman has been sculpted sitting here. The temple is waterlogged during monsoons when the Ganga overflows, and that is an added reason why the temple is sacred. Visit there and that will be a sure spiritual experience in your lovely Prayagraj sojourn.</p>
                   <h2 className="mt-5 font-bold">8. Go for a stroll around Alfred Park (Chandrashekhar Azad Park)</h2>
