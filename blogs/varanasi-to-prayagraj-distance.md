Varanasi to Prayagraj Distance
</h2>
<p>
          Varanasi and Prayagraj are both approximately the same distance from each other, at approximately 120–130 kilometres, depending on the route. Otherwise, it is approximately 3 to 4 hours by road. One gets an impression about the cultural life of Uttar Pradesh from a drive because villages, small townships, and green fields come on the way. Both cities are pilgrimage cities and therefore, a visit to one gets the true feel of the destination.
