Introduction: The Sacred Spirit of Ayodhya and Varanasi
</h2>
<p>
           Benaras, Varanasi, or Kashi, whichever name seems appropriate to call it by, for even cities fall prey to such popularity, is one of the oldest living cities in the world. It is a serene and sacred city on the sacred banks of the sacred River Ganges. Ayodhya, the legendary birthplace of Lord Rama, is imbued with religious energies by its temples, river ghats, and ancient ruins. All these sites combined provide a very distinct experience to pilgrims and travellers alike.

              <h3 className="mt-3 font-bold">2. Dashashwamedh Ghat</h3>
              <p>Smothered in its holy Ganga Aarti, the ghats are the thumping heart of Varanasi. diyas that swell and recede in the Ganges and holy shlokas that tinkle in the air, the tourist is rooted deep in India's religious past.</p>
              <h3 className="mt-3 font-bold">3. Sarnath</h3>
              <p>Half-day outing from the city, Sarnath is where Lord Buddha gave his initial sermon. Sarnath Museum and Dhamek Stupa make it the go-to place of all spiritual philosophers and history enthusiasts.</p>
              <h3 className="mt-3 font-bold">4. Manikarnika Ghat</h3>
              <p>Hindu's most sacred cremation ground, Manikarnika Ghat, is the epitome of the ageless Hindu school of thought on issues of death and birth. Watching rituals being carried out here is a straightforward but melancholic experience.</p>
