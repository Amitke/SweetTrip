Understanding the Spiritual and Cultural Landscape of Varanasi

           Varanasi, or Kashi for that matter, is a city where spirituality and tradition are constantly on the move along the holy Ganges River. The ancient temples, winding lanes, and vibrant ghats of the city attract millions of tourists and pilgrims from around the world. Being close to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, Dashashwamedh Ghat, or Assi Ghat means being able to behold the sacred Ganga Aarti, the boat rides in the morning, and the heart-wrenching toll of temple bells.
