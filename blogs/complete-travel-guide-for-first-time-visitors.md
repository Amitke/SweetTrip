What is Triveni Sangam?
</h2>
<p>
           Where the three rivers Yamuna, Ganga, and mythical Saraswati converge is "Triveni Sangam." It is located at Prayagraj and is one of the sacred sites for Hindus. Pilgrims believe that a dip there would wash away sin and result in liberation from a spiritual point of view. Where the clean greenish water of the Yamuna merges with the filth of the Ganga can be seen.

              Religious Significance of Prayagraj Triveni Sangam
              </h2>
              <p>Prayagraj Triveni Sangam is founded in Hindu mythology and scriptures. It is said to be the site where a few drops of "Amrit" (nectar of immortality) have fallen to the ground during the asuras-devas war in the divine war, and thus one of the four sites for Kumbh Mela. Crores of devotees come here for a sacred bath during the Kumbh Mela and Magh Mela. To pilgrims, saints, and sages, Sangam is not merely a junction of rivers but an encounter with the ages on the canvas of spirituality. Best Time to Visit Triveni Sangam Prayagraj</p>
