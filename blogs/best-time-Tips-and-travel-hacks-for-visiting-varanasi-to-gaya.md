Best Time to Visit Varanasi to Gaya
</h2>
<p>
           It will be worth choosing an appropriate time to travel from Gaya to Varanasi.
              </p>
              <h3 className="mt-3 font-bold">
              1. Winter Season (October to March)
              </h3>
               <p>
                Winter is the optimal time to travel. The weather is very pleasant, 10°C to 25°C, and thus one can simply relax while moving between temples and walking during sightseeing tours. Heat and heavy rain is not what one has to be concerned about while observing ghats of Varanasi and spiritual Bodh Gaya.
              </p>
               <h3 className="mt-3 font-bold">
             2. Avoid visiting during Monsoon Season (July to September)
              </h3>
               <p>
               Even though monsoon rains are strangely greenish in color, they are enough to hamper your tour plans. The roads become slippery, and temples or any other famous sites end up being shut. If you don't want to get interrupted in the middle of your trip, then it is preferable to avoid these months.
              </p>
              <h3 className="mt-3 font-bold">3. Festivals and Special Events</h3>
              <p>Attend festivals such as Diwali at Varanasi or Buddha Jayanti at Gaya to add magic to your trip. Do remember that these periods are peak season too, so book well in advance.</p>
              <h2 className="mt-5 font-bold">Travel Tips from Varanasi to Gaya</h2>
